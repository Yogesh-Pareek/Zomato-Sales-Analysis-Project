# Zomato-Sales-Analysis-Project
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of Zomato's restaurant data. Key tasks included building a country map table and a detailed calendar table with various date-related columns. The analysis focused on the distribution of restaurants by city, country, year, quarter, and month. Additionally, I examined restaurant counts based on average ratings and created price buckets to categorize them. I also calculated the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery options. Visualizations were developed using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, showcasing insights based on cuisines, cities, and ratings.
